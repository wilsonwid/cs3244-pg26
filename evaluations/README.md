### Evaluations

This folder contains all the model evaluations for three models that have been chosen by our team, namely:
* Rolling bagging regressor
* Rolling kNN regressor
* Rolling XGBoost regressor

These three have been chosen due to their efficacy in predicting CPI-corrected per-square-metre resale flat prices based on performance metrics such as the MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), and MdAPE (median absolute percentage error).
