Our project certainly has a few possible future improvements that are worthy of being implemented. These include:

* Using a voting regressor, which uses several distinct models to 'vote' for property prices hence allowing us to amalgamate several models together.
* Developing additional methods for model explainability, such as visualisations of the data points for kNN regressor.
* Ensembling other base regressors besides decision trees.
