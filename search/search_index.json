This dataset contains the historical transactions of resale Housing Development Board (HDB) flats from 1990 to present, detailing these columns: Column name Description month Sale month of the resale flat town HDB towns; list available here flat_type HDB flat types; list available here block Block number of the resale flat street_name Street name of HDB flat storey_range Range of storeys for HDB flat floor_area_sqm Area of the flat (in square metres) flat_model HDB flat model lease_commencement_date Lease commencement date (YYYY format) remaining_lease Remaining lease length (in years) resale_price Transacted price (in S$) That being said, some of the files do not have the \"remaining lease period\" column, for which we can impute using the assumption that HDB flats have a 99-year lease starting from the lease commencement date, which is provided in all the data files. We believe that the dataset is reliable given that it is provided by the Housing and Development Board and available for public download via the first link above. Furthermore, we can be confident that the data is updated, as is indicated from its metadata given in the same link.","title":"Dataset"},{"location":"evaluations/","text":"This section contains all the data visualisations and/or analyses that we have done for the three best models we have created and selected based on preliminary performance metrics.
