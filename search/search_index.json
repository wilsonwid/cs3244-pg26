This dataset contains the historical transactions of resale Housing Development Board (HDB) flats from 1990 to present, detailing these columns: Column name Description month Sale month of the resale flat town HDB towns; list available here flat_type HDB flat types; list available here block Block number of the resale flat street_name Street name of HDB flat storey_range Range of storeys for HDB flat floor_area_sqm Area of the flat (in square metres) flat_model HDB flat model lease_commencement_date Lease commencement date (YYYY format) remaining_lease Remaining lease length (in years) resale_price Transacted price (in S$) That being said, some of the files do not have the \"remaining lease period\" column, for which we can impute using the assumption that HDB flats have a 99-year lease starting from the lease commencement date, which is provided in all the data files. We believe that the dataset is reliable given that it is provided by the Housing and Development Board and available for public download via the first link above.

Plan # In achieving this goal, we: Collated all our data into a single, unified dataset where all our analysis will be conducted in. Plotted bar charts of the various categories for flat_model , town , and flat_type to detect categories that have very small counts. This is to group these into an other group that represents the minority categories for each feature. Used pandas_profiling to allow for automated EDA report generation. The report is available here . Plots # In grouping the three features into an other category as above, we decided to put the boundaries as (in terms of counts): 9,000 for flat_model 50,000 for flat_type 12,000 for town (note that Sembawang is still included as a separate category) Preliminary analysis # We discovered several features of the dataset, including: High correlation between the floor area, resale price, and lease commencement date. High correlation between flat model, flat type, floor area, and lease commencement date. High correlation between town, flat model, and lease commencement date. Missing remaining lease data for most of the columns, which is imputable using a 99-year HDB lease assumption.

With an automated model that makes price predictions given a set of property characteristics, we have a systematic and unbiased way of getting valuation estimates which are faster and cheaper. Such a model can also reduce fraud cases in valuations, given that the property features that serve as the model's input are not tampered with. Appraisers can use this model to get a first-cut estimate on valuation of properties and supplement it with additional human knowledge of the uniqueness of each property. Furthermore, sellers can use the model to get an estimation of their existing property\u2019s value to arrive at a competitive ask price, while buyers can be more informed to fairly assess their options. In essence, all parties are able to come towards a conclusive price point for a transaction to happen without under- or over-valuing the property.","title":"Motivation"}]}
