With an automated model that makes price predictions given a set of property characteristics, we have a systematic and unbiased way of getting valuation estimates which are faster and cheaper. Such a model can also reduce fraud cases in valuations, given that the property features that serve as the model's inputs are not tampered with. Appraisers can use this model to get a first-cut estimate on valuation of properties and supplement it with additional human knowledge of the uniqueness of each property. Furthermore, sellers can use the model to get an estimation of their existing property\u2019s value to arrive at a competitive ask price, while buyers can be more informed to fairly assess their options. In essence, all parties are able to come towards a conclusive price point for a transaction to happen without under- or over-valuing the property.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"navigate-repo/","text":"The repository for our project is available on GitHub . data_raw : All the raw data taken from our dataset sources data_processed : Data that has undergone some form of processing docs : Files for documentation website; necessary for MkDocs to function well evaluations : In-depth model evaluations we completed for three selected models, namely a rolling bagging regressor, rolling kNN regressor, and rolling XGBoost regressor.
