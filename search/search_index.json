In this project, we have used various libraries and their API documentations. These include, but are not limited to: Scikit-learn , a well-known library that has various implementations of things used in a machine learning pipeline. XGBoost , an \"optimised, distributed gradient boosting library\". TensorFlow 2.0 , a deep learning library that is integrated with the Keras high-level API. NumPy , a numerical computation library that is optimised for vectorised computations. Seaborn , a plotting library built on top of Matplotlib. Matplotlib , a plotting library. Pandas , a data manipulation library. Scipy , a scientific computation library. Additionally, Google Colaboratory was used for model training.","title":"Credits"},{"location":"evaluations/","text":"This section contains all the data visualisations and/or analyses that we have done for the three best models we have created and selected based on preliminary performance metrics. These performance metrics include the mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), \\(R^2\\) (the coefficient of determination), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the median absolute percentage error (MdAPE).
